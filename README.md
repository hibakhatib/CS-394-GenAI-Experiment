-  Does the code work? If not, what's broken.
    The code does not work. The main error right now is a CORS issue, a CANNOT GET/ error, for both the frontend and backend. The code is supposed to make a website where the page is fully editable on click as in site editors like Wix but right now it does not even run and has issues with using Lit Element components correctly. 

-  How is the code better than what the team currently has?
    The code is much worse.

- How is the code worse?
    The code doesn't actually work. Both frontend and backend code has a CANNOT GET / error. Additionally, I asked GPT3.5 to create a local backend which is different from our task which uses a firebase backend. Our firebase backend belongs to the client so I thought asking GPT to create a local database would be easier. However, it failed at creating something functional for both frontend and backend. 

- How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
  
    It took many tries to no avail. It seems to be getting confused. It produces code with outdated use of Lit Element and Typescript which causes errors. After fixing these issues, the code still does not appear to work with the required tech stack. 

- Overall impression of the experience

    It is nice to start with some things done for you but it is not worth the effort to keep prompting and testing to get something right. It is frustrating when GPT gets confused and doesn't give you what you asked for. I would use GPT for smaller things but to use GPT to do our entire project would be difficult.
